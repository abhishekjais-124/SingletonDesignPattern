# SingletonDesignPattern
LLD for Singleton Design Pattern

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
A common real-life analogy is that of an office printer being shared by multiple employees. A single instance of the printer that everyone can access is more useful than creating new instances for each person that wants to print a document.
